Communications Protocol
=======================
There is no standard protocol because every configuration has a different set of hardware attached.
So for each installation, we would need to write a different set of protocols.
   
Terminology
===========
Nodes are hierarchial and can comprise of other nodes (i.e. nodes can be sets of nodes).
But at their most basic level each sensor or actuator can be its own node and nodes can consist of inputs and/or outputs.
